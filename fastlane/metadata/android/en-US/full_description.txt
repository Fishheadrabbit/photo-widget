<b>Material Photo Widget</b> is as simple as it can be: a home screen widget to
display a photo or collection of photos. It is a free, no-ads, open source
alternative for people who want to customize their home screen with their
favorite photos.

It's <b>easy</b> and <b>simple</b> to add a new widget with your photos. Start
from the app or directly from the home screen widget browser on your preferred
launcher.

<b>FEATURES</b>

* 5 aspect ratios: square, tall, wide, original and fill widget
* Customize your square widgets with 10 different shapes
* Customize the rounded corners of your tall, wide or original widgets
* Customize the opacity, offset and padding
* Choose each photo or sync the widget with device folders
* Set an optional interval and have photos flip automatically
* Choose the tap action of each widget: none, view next photo, view in full
  screen or open another app

<b>PERMISSIONS</b>

* INSTALL_SHORTCUT — Declared to ensure that widgets can be placed correctly on
