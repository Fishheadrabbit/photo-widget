<b>Material Photo Widget</b> is as simple as it can be: a home screen widget to
display a photo or collection of photos. It is a free, no-ads, open source
alternative for people who want to customize their home screen with their
favorite photos.

from the app or directly from the home screen widget browser on your preferred
launcher.
