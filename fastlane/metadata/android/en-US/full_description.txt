It's <b>easy</b> and <b>simple</b> to add a new widget with your photos.

<b>FEATURES</b>

  automatically

* Customizable borders, opacity, saturation, brightness, offset and padding to
  create your perfect home screen

<b>HOW TO USE</b>

Open the app and tap "Create a new widget" directly from the home screen.
Add your photos, choose the appearance and behaviors and tap "Add to home
screen". That's it!

You can also long press on your home screen, open the widget menu and search
for "Material Photo Widget", then configure your new widget the same way.

<b>MY WIDGET DOES NOT APPEAR</b>

The app consumes very little power and runs on the background when needed (to
switch photos, for example). Because it's rarely being actively used, it can
be stopped by Android as the system prioritizes the most used apps when trying
to optimize the battery duration.

If you are facing this problem, remove any battery or memory restrictions from
the app. You can also search for your device brand on https://dontkillmyapp.com
and follow their instructions to improve the behavior of apps that mostly run
on the background.

Some phones can prevent apps from starting themselves after restarting the
device, making the widget can appear broken. If that's happening, you must
grant permission for the app to "auto start" through your settings or security
app.

<b>PERMISSIONS</b>

* RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED — This permission is needed to restore widgets after a
  device restart. Some device manufacturers prevent this from happening, and
  you must manually allow it through the "auto-start" setting on your phone.
* SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM (optional) — This is an optional permission that is
  needed if you would like to use shorter intervals to switch photos, ensuring
  that they follow the selected schedule exactly.
* WAKE_LOCK & FOREGROUND_SERVICE — These permissions are used by Work Manager;
  a standard Android library to manage background work, in this case, used to
  ensure that the widget keeps functioning as expected.

The app does not require any storage permissions. Photos and directories are
selected using the native pickers and stored within the app to keep data
private and secure. There's no tracking or network communication.
